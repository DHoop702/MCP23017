## Class MCP23017

Encapsulates all communication with the MCP23017 IC

### Constructors

#### MCP23017()

Initializes a new instance of the MCP23017 IC with default I2C address (A0 - A2 connected to ground)  

#### MCP23017(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr)

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 IC with the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A2 pins are needed)  

### Methods

#### MCP23017::Pin& getPin(uint8_t pin)

Gets a single pin in order to let you modify or read it.

#### void setup() const

Initializes the MCP23017 chip with your settings for your pins (mode, interrupt, polarity). This method can be called everytime you want to change your setup. No need to restart the IC for changes.

#### void read()

Read all input values for all pins from MCP23017

#### void write() const;

Write all output values for all pins to MCP23017





## Class MCP23017::Pin

Encapsulates a single I/O pin on the MCP23017 IC

### Methods

#### uint8_t getPinMode() const

Gets the pin mode of this pin

Constant | Value | Description
---------|-------|------------
INPUT | 0 | The pin is in input mode
OUTPUT | 1 | The pin is in output mode
INPUT_PULLUP | 2 | The pin is in input mode and pulled up to high

Default value is INPUT

#### void setPinMode(uint8_t mode)

Sets the pin mode of this pin

**You need to call MCP23017::setup() for changes to take effect**

#### uint8_t getInterrupt() const

Gets the interrupt mode of this pin

Constant | Value | Description
---------|-------|------------
false | 0 | No interrupt on this pin
CHANGE | 1 | Interrupt is fired on pin state change
FALLING | 2 | Interrupt is fired on pin falling
RISING | 3 | Interrupt is fired on pin rising

Default value is false (no interrupt)

#### void setInterrupt(uint8_t interrupt)

Sets the interrupt mode of this pin

**You need to call MCP23017::setup() for changes to take effect**

#### bool getPolarityInvert() const

Gets a boolean indicating if polarity invert is active for this pin

#### void setPolarityInvert(bool polarityInvert)

Sets the polarity invert for this pin

**You need to call MCP23017::setup() for changes to take effect**

#### uint8_t getValue() const()

Gets the current value (HIGH/LOW) of this pin

**You need to call MCP23017::read() to read the actual value of the pin from the IC**

#### void setValue(uint8_t value)

Sets the current value (HIGH/LOW) for this pin

**You need to call MCP23017::write() to set the actual pin on the IC**
